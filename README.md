ðŸ©º Heart Disease Prediction using ANN and ML Models

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease using both Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and traditional Machine Learning (ML) models.
It includes detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation using various algorithms to identify the best-performing model.

ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The dataset contains multiple clinical features such as:

Age

Sex

Chest pain type

Resting blood pressure

Serum cholesterol

Fasting blood sugar

Resting ECG results

Maximum heart rate achieved

Exercise-induced angina

ST depression and slope

Number of major vessels and thalassemia type

Through EDA, patterns and correlations between these features and heart disease presence are explored using plots like histograms, pie charts, and heatmaps.

ðŸ¤– Models Used

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) â€” Built using TensorFlow/Keras

Random Forest Classifier
